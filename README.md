# Algorithms Repository

This repository covers a broad range of fundamental algorithms that are crucial for understanding the core principles of computer science and software engineering.

## Categories

### Sorting Algorithms
We will cover 5 key sorting algorithms:
- **Bubble Sort**: Introduction to sorting, demonstrating basic algorithm design and its inefficiencies.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple algorithm that works well for small or partially sorted arrays.
- **Merge Sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses partitioning to recursively divide and conquer.
- **Heap Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by using the properties of a heap data structure.

### Search Algorithms
- **Linear Search**: The simplest search algorithm, a basic demonstration of searching.
- **Binary Search**: A fast algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures, starting at the root and exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for searching a tree or graph that explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

### Graph Algorithms

### Data Structure Algorithms
- **Binary Search Tree (BST) Operations**: Insertion, deletions, and search operations in a BST.
- **Balancing Trees**: Algorithms like AVL or Red-Black Tree that ensures that the tree remains balanced for optimal operations.

### Dynamic Programming

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Activity Selection Problem**: An introductory problem to understand greedy method.
- **Huffman Coding**: A compression algorithm that uses a greedy approach to reduce the average cost of encoding symbols.

### String Algorithms
